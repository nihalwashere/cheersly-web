          Do you feel like you are working in isolation?

          We wanted to make appreciation a little fun. While the pandemic has
          been a little demanding and all of us pushed to remote work. We
          believe for most of the teams this is going to continue where remote
          work will be everything. Having said that, it often becomes a little
          boring while working from home (alone). We thought of building a Slack
          app that helps to share in some cheers with your peers and spread joy!
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          You should share in some cheers with your peers because it makes the
          recipient feel good about themselves and this can help to boost their
          performance. Cheersly provides the kind of positive experience or
          uplift that can increase people’s morale, motivation, engagement and
          renew their commitment to their organization.

          By implementing gratitude into company culture, employees are more
          willing to spread their positive feelings with others, whether it’s
          helping out with a project or taking time to notice and recognizing
          those that have gone the extra mile.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          Showing gratitude can increase a person’s wellness, increase better
          sleep habits, increase metabolism and lessen stress. This directly
          impacts work results and employee interaction. With employee
          appreciation, you’re not only boosting performance and engagement, but
          the employee’s well-being and health.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          The greatest psychological effect of appreciation and gratitude is the
          happiness and other emotions immediately felt whether we’re giving or
          benefiting from. Gratitude creates good feelings, cheerful memories,
          better self-esteem, feeling more relaxed and more optimistic. All of
          these emotions creates a pay it forward and “we’re in this together”
          mentality in the workplace, which in turn, makes your organization
          more successful. Plus, the dopamine effect will encourage a continuous
          cycle of recognition if everyone participates. All of these emotions,
          plus many more, are what most employers want out of their staff to
          again, create unity.

          According to a case study, most millennials quit because they feel no
          one said thank you, they feel unappreciated.
